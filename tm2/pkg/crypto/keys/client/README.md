# keys/client (Deprecated)

## Deprecation Notice

The `client` package has been deprecated. The functionality that was previously offered by this package is now available in `gno.land/pkg/keycli`. This change has been made to streamline the project structure and enhance maintainability.

For more details on this transition, please refer to the following resources:
- **Issue Discussion**: [Issue #1174](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/issues/1174)
- **Pull Request**: [PR #1438](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/pull/1438)

If you are still using this `client` package, it is recommended to migrate your code to use `gno.land/pkg/keycli` instead.
