# Gno.land Go Client

This is a Go client library for interacting with the Gno.land RPC API.
The library provides a convenient way to make requests to the Gno.land API endpoints and process the responses.

## Installation

To use this library, you can add it to your Go project using `go get`:

    go get github.com/gnolang/gno/gno.land/pkg/gnoclient

## Plan

TODO: improve
* bootstrap the effort here for gno.land, then move the generic functions to tm2/gnovm/gnosdk later.
* start using this library in `gno.land/cmd/*` and external clients such as `gnoblog-client` or the discord community faucet bot.
* as soon as we've a strong generic client, let's try to use codegen to ease creating typesafe contract-specific clients.

## Usage
