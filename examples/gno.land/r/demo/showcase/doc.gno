/*
Package showcase provides a framework for creating small modules that showcase
numerous details and expose various usages.

The primary goal is to facilitate easy demonstration and exploration of small
features. Modules self-register, expose commands, and demonstrate different
aspects. This framework encourages experimentation and creativity, allowing
developers to easily add new modules while keeping the main files untouched.
